# dbt_linkedin_pages v1.0.0

[PR #21](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_pages/pull/21) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Changes

### Source Package Consolidation
- Removed the dependency on the `fivetran/linkedin_pages_source` package.
  - All functionality from the source package has been merged into this transformation package for improved maintainability and clarity.
  - If you reference `fivetran/linkedin_pages_source` in your `packages.yml`, you must remove this dependency to avoid conflicts.
  - Any source overrides referencing the `fivetran/linkedin_pages_source` package will also need to be removed or updated to reference this package.
  - Update any linkedin_pages_source-scoped variables to be scoped to only under this package. See the [README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_linkedin_pages/blob/main/README.md) for how to configure the build schema of staging models.
- As part of the consolidation, vars are no longer used to reference staging models, and only sources are represented by vars. Staging models are now referenced directly with `ref()` in downstream models.

### dbt Fusion Compatibility Updates
- Updated package to maintain compatibility with dbt-core versions both before and after v1.10.6, which introduced a breaking change to multi-argument test syntax (e.g., `unique_combination_of_columns`).
- Temporarily removed unsupported tests to avoid errors and ensure smoother upgrades across different dbt-core versions. These tests will be reintroduced once a safe migration path is available.
  - Removed all `dbt_utils.unique_combination_of_columns` tests.
  - Removed all `accepted_values` tests.
  - Moved `loaded_at_field: _fivetran_synced` under the `config:` block in `src_linkedin_pages.yml`.

## Under the Hood
- Updated conditions in `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`.
- Added `.github/workflows/generate-docs.yml`.

The original release! The main focus of the package is to transform the core social media object tables into analytics-ready models that can be easily unioned in to other social media platform packages to get a single view. This is especially easy using our [Social Media Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_social_media_reporting).
